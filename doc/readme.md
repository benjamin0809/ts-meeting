- **TSLint Vue-TSX**
VSCode extension for tslint with added support for .vue files (single file component) and compiler/typechecker level linting. This is a fork of vscode-tslint.
- **TSLint **
Adds tslint to VS Code using the TypeScript TSLint language service plugin.
- **Prettier Formatter**
Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
- **ESLint**
The extension uses the ESLint library installed in the opened workspace folder. If the folder doesn't provide one the extension looks for a global install version. If you haven't installed ESLint either locally or globally do so by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder for a local install or npm install -g eslint for a global install.
- **Auto Import**
Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports. Works with Typescript and TSX.
